	/* This task requires you to bind data to elements and shade them according to a certain metric, in this case, the GST contribution.
	A scale has alreaddy been created to translate the GST values to colour with a quantize scale.

	Your task is to create the actual heatmap and use this scale to apply colour to each element.

	A few things to consider:

	1. Positioning the elements - What are the rows going to be? What about the columns? You will need to manipulate the positions of the elements you create.
	2. User Interaction - You can create a simple mousover user interaction for aesthetics if you wish.
	3. Text Labels - Text labels are optional, but aren't that hard to make. You'll need to create a new selection if you wish to do so. */

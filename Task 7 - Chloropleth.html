		1. Write your own colour scale with an appropriate domain (find the extent maybe?). Keep in mind that you'll need to different scales for different metrics (HDB, Total, etc)
		2. Modify the code below to color in each subzone according to the scale (s) you created.
		3. Add some sort of user interaction to understand the other metric (HDB, total, etc). You could consider writing a completely different visualization, such as a bar chart, that changes
		depending on interaction with the map. Or you could between the different metrics. */

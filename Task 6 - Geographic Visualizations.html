	/* In this task we'll be moving to geographic visualizations and dealing with GeoJSON data.

	Your task is to :
	1. Complete the code below and add the other two tracks provided in the MRT_data folder
	2. Modify the code (or write a new function) to add the stations for each line from the provided MRT_data folder */

	/* The d3.json() function works in pretty much the same way as d3.csv(). The singapore.json file is a GEO JSON of Singapore, divided according to its planning areas. */
	d3.json('singapore.json',function(data) {


		/* The next sequence of functions might be confusing, lets look at them one by one */

		/* A projection transforms geographic coordinates into 2D coordinates. D3 caters to a wide range of projections, but this particular function handles the Mercator projection. */

		var projection = d3.geoMercator();

		/* The geoCentroid() function finds the centroid of a set of  GeoJSON features. This is necessary since the dataset we're using is focused on Singapore 
		which won't be visible on the SVG base, which is quite small, if the center of the Earth itself is taken. */

		var center = d3.geoCentroid(data);

		/* This centers the projection according to the centroid that was just calculated */

		projection.center(center);
	
		/* The geoPath() function translates GeoJSON features (which could be complex shapes or boundaries) into instructions for a path element's d attribute */

 		var paths = d3.geoPath().projection(projection);

 		/* Finally, Singapore is really small with respect to the world. It is necessary to blow up the projection so that an appreciably sized Singapore is visible on the SVG base.
 		Note that the argument to scale really depends on the raw data you get. I manually experimented to obtain this particular value */

		projection.scale(84000);

		var svg = d3.select('#svg');

		svg.append('path')
			.attr('class','bounds')
			.datum(data)
			.attr('d',paths)
			.style('fill','none')
			.style('stroke','#A8A8A8')

		/* The d3 queue() function allows the sequential execution of asynchronous tasks such as loading files. 
		While in this case, we don't particularly require the files to be loaded sequentially, it sure is convenient.
		The function takes another function and that functions arguments as its arguments */

		d3.queue()
			.defer(render_lines,'MRT_data/NSL_track.geojson','red')
			.defer(render_lines,'MRT_data/EWL_track.geojson','green')

		/* Write your code here */

		/* This render function takes a particular GEO JSON file name, containing a MRT track, and a color then loads the file and colors the stroke
		of the track with the given color before appending it to the SVG base.*/

		function render_lines(file,color) {

			d3.json(file,function (data) {

				svg.append('path')
